Jaiffa
======

Jaiffa (Javascript Interactive Fiction/Adventures) is a toy
library for the creation of text adventures that can be embedded in
a Web page. It was created as a programming exercise and idea
testbed. Jaiffa is small, fast, and easy to use, study or modify.
See the included HTML files for details. (Also available on the
[project website](http://felix.plesoianu.ro/index.php/page:Fun:IF:Jaiffa).)

Jaiffa was made for learning purposes. For real-world usage, you
might want to watch David Wheeler's fork
